I’m working with the in-house design team of a large corporation on a web-based internal communication project. As with all my collaborations, I’m consulting heavily during the design process to help the design team understand the technologies are at their disposal and to ensure that realistic expectations are maintained.

As it happens often (particularly with teams not accustomed to designing for the web) the first draft was designed with only desktops and laptops in mind. I quickly raised the question of mobile, but that question got put in the back-burner while other issues perceived as “more pressing” were dealt with.

Eventually the question of mobile could no longer be ignored, and the designers finally started drafting mockups for what the site could look and work like on smaller devices.

{.callout} The results were a testament to the power of constraints.

The exercise yielded an elegant, clear, and highly efficient communication piece that rivaled the layouts we’d been working with for the two weeks prior. Everybody on the team was so excited about these new mockups, we immediately agreed that new mockups needed to be drafted for desktop, building on the conventions established in mobile mockups. A couple of days ago, I was greeted with a better, clearer, more efficient mockup for larger screens. And it owes a lot to the mobile layout from which it springs.

It was immediately clear why mobile-first is a valuable approach not just for developers building a front-end, but for designers as well. As I thought out-loud “This is why we design mobile-first!”, the lead designer said she originally hadn’t thought mobile layouts would play such an important role. After all, mobile use within the company’s intranet is still well below 10%, she said, so it made (common) sense to attend to it only *after* nailing down other design concerns, if at all. I say “(common) sense” because it only makes sense in the context of web stats. Little did she expect that designing for mobile would do so much more than merely cater to a tiny fraction of her target audience. Far more importantly, designing for mobile helped her get a better grasp of the communication challenges that the project faces by forcing her to concentrate on doing more with less. By subjecting herself to the constraints of a device with a small screen and not a whole lot of power, she achieved the best layout we’ve seen on this project yet.

The lesson here is that mobile-first isn’t really about screen real-estate, or device capabilities. These are only the arenas through which we apply the end result of this approach, and they erroneously subject our use of mobile-first to device statistics. At its core, mobile-first is about uncluttering our solutions and focusing on what a project actually needs, which ultimately leads to design that communicates more effectively.
