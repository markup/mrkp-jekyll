Writing, not unlike teaching, is an excellent learning exercise. I’ve known this for some time now, yet never got around to writing more than a few notes-to-self in snarky commit messages.

During 2013, I had the pleasure of working with the good folks at the now-defunct [D+J](http://dplusj.com). While working with them, and because of several communication practices I took part in, I had the opportunity to rediscover the value of writing things down. Its value is two-fold: the writing exercise itself forces us to examine our work and our experience creating it, and the final product leaves a document we can reference later.

Late last year, during the Holiday break, I decided to finally dedicate an honest chunk of time and effort to [/markup’s website](http://mrkp.co/). The previous site was OK in that it was better than nothing, so it was high time I put out something that better reflects my skills, my work, and the principles that drive that work. In an effort to share these principles and my learning process, I’ve decided to occasionally share my thoughts on matters of design, development, and how these two interact (plus related topics and announcements) via this blog.
