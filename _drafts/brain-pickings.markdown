I often do a lot of informal consulting with friends, colleagues and acquaintances about design and development topics. Typically, there’s something they want to do or a problem they need to solve, and either they need help figuring out the right approach or want to hear my overall impressions on the situation at hand. I really enjoy these short engagements; they pull me out of my work bubble, give me the chance to consider different challenges, contemplate fresh ideas and sometimes I get to offer actual solutions.

I’d like more of those, so in the spirit of —[to paraphrase Ray Bradbury][bradbury]— jumping off the cliff and building wings on the way down, here’s what I’m gonna do.

## I present to you: Pick-My-Brain Fridays
It’s a very simple thing, really. Every Friday afternoon, I’ll set aside two or three hours for unbridled brain-picking. You are free to reserve a one-hour block during which you and your problem/idea/question will have **my full attention**. In exchange, you’ll buy me a drink or two (espresso, water or soda). We’ll meet at a coffee shop (or some other place conducive to quick meetings) in downtown Chattanooga.

I’ve already had two prototype pick-my-brain sessions. The first session was with [Seun Erinle] [seun], who wanted to run an idea by me about an amazing after-school educational project she’s working on for young kids. So I offered some initial remarks, answered specific questions she had for me, and asked a few questions of my own which —I hope— help her ideas move forward. Needless to say, I was honored to be amongst the knowledgeable peeps she’s been talking to about this, and I can’t wait to see the fruits of her labor.

The second session was with the absurdly talented [Kerry O’Connor] [kerry] in which I helped her out with a simple DNS issue on her soon-to-come website. Nothing major, and certainly nothing she couldn’t have figured out on her own. But she wanted some help, and I was happy to lend a hand. We got a chance to catch up, I got a (much needed) Cortado, and her DNS woes were taken care of. An all-around win.

You might want help solving a problem, or really just framing the problem. Maybe you need a fresh pair of ears on an idea you’ve been brewing, or know exactly what service/product/app you want to build yet have no idea where to start or who to start it with. Whatever it is, I’d love to help. Don’t worry: It doesn’t have to lead to work (though if it does, all the better!), and your gazillion-dollar ideas are safe with me.

So [hit me up on Twitter] [mytwitter] and let’s move things forward.
